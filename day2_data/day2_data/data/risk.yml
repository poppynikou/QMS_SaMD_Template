      hazard: Incorrect information
      software_item: Annotation Metric Calculator
      causes: |
          - A software defect in the Annotation Metric Calculator causes the
            size an annotated tumor to be significantly under-estimated
          - The radiologist fails to notice the discrepancy
      effects: The oncologist is presented with incorrect tumor sizes
      harm: An inappropriate therapy is given to the patient
      severity: Catastrophic
      likelihood: Low
      risk: 5
      risk_control: null
      residual_severity: null
      residual_likelihood: null
      residual_risk: null
      comment: Although it is not possible to estimate the probability of the
          software defect occurring, it is unlikely that the radiologist would not
          noticed the discrepancy.
