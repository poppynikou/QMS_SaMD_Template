## Introduction

_Purpose of the Clinical Safety Case Report and phase of lifecycle it relates to._

## System Definition / Overview

_Description of the Health IT System; identification of Health IT System part and version number; description of the 
clinical environment it is to be used in; description of any existing systems it replaces or interfaces with; number of
users and patients._

## Clinical Risk Management System
_Description of the Manufacturerâ€™s clinical risk management system; identification of key personnel, their roles and 
responsibilities; identification of clinical risk management governance structure._

The clinical risk management system is described in the Clinical Risk Management Plan document, which follows DBC0129
[1]. The clinical safety case has been developed in accordance with the CSC QMS [2].

Clinical safety activities have been undertaken by the CSC team under the supervision and with collaboration with 
the CSO. Persons responsible for this process are listed at the start of this CSCR.

## Medical Device Declaration

The {{device.name}} application has a Class {{device.mhra_class}} MHRA classification.   

[Guidance for MHRA classification](https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations)


## Clinical Risk Analysis
_Hazard identification; description of patient safety consequences; explanation of hazard causes and contributory 
conditions; identification of existing mitigating controls; estimation of clinical risk; identification of participating
personnel._

Risk analysis methods are explained in the Clinical Risk Management Plan.

Hazard identification, risk evaluation and risk control meetings were conducted with key stakeholders throughout the
design and development stages.

## Clinical Risk Evaluation
_Evaluation of initial level of risk of each identified hazard using pre-defined criteria._

Risks are evaluated against the severity and likelihood scales in appendix 1, taken from DCB 0129.


## Clinical Risk Control
_Identification, justification, implementation and verification of adequate risk controls; residual clinical risk 
evaluation and completion of controls._ 

The risk controls identified against causes for risks which are evaluated as un-acceptable in the risk acceptability 
chart in Appendix 2.



## Hazard Log
The hazard log is available at <a href="documentation/release/hazard_log.md">release/hazard_log.md</a>

## Test Issues
Summary of any outstanding test issues and the impact on clinical safety.

## Summary Safety Statement
Statement from the Clinical Safety Officer summarising the safety position of the Health IT System in the context of 
the intended deployment. 

## Quality Assurance and Document Approval
Evidence of appropriate quality, review and approval regimes.

## Configuration Control / Management
Evidence of appropriate configuration control being used.
