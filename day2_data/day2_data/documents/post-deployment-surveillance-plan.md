## 3. Data Collection Categories

At minimum, the information required by the process for post-deployement surveillance is collected. For (enter
product name), the following categories of data will be collected specifically:

### Information about other devices\*

- Pubmed
  - Filter: (define)
  - Time span: last 12 months
- (...)

### Serious incidents of our medical device

- Incident documentation
  - None

### Non-serious incidents and undesirable side-effects of our own medical device

- Feedback and customer complaints
  - None

### Feedback we collect from our partners, users, distributors, importers

- Feedback and customer complaints
  - Filter: not hazard-related feedback, feedback to performance, safety or processes
  - Time span:

### Trends

- Compile list of trends as described in the section below.

## 4. Trend Analysis

Trend analysis is performed with a focus on undesirable side-effects and non-serious incidents. These will be
monitored if they impact the benefit-risk ratio in a negative way.

Hazards in the risk table are compared to post-market surveillance results:

- If post-deployment surveillance leads to the finding that the estimated **probability** was too low (= event
  happened more often in post-market surveillance), actions are initiated as described in the SOP Post-Market
  Surveillance.
- If post-deployment surveillance leads to the finding that the estimated **severity** was too low (= event
  happened led to more serious harm in post-market surveillance), a CAPA is initiated.
